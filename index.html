    <h3>Short Brief About Ambedkar -------------</h3>
    <p>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar <b>(14 April 1891 â€“ 6 December 1956)</b> was an Indian jurist, economist and Dalit leader who
        headed the committee drafting the Constitution of India from the Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and
        Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after
        renouncing Hinduism.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>His Education -------------</h3>
    <p>In 1908, Ambedkar passed his tenth class from the <i><b>Elphinstone High School</b></i>. He graduated from <i>Bombay University </i>
        1912 and his subjects included political studies and economics. Ambedkar was an intelligent student and cleared
        all his exams without much problem. Gaekwad ruler of, Sahyaji Rao III was so impressed with him that he gave a
        scholarship of 25 rupees per month to Ambedkar. Ambedkar used all that money to continue his studies outside
        India. He applied for Columbia University in New York to complete his master's degree in Economics.
    </p>
    <p>
        He was selected in that university and <i><b>completed his master's degree in 1915</b></i> and this is the time when he gave
        his thesis called <b>'Ancient Indian Commerce</b>. In 1916, he started working on his new thesis, 'The problem of the
        rupee: Its origin and its solution' and this was the time when he applied for the London School of Economics and
        got selected. In this thesis, he was also helped by Governor Lord Sydenham. In Sydenham College of Commerce and
        Economics, he became a political science professor, but he decided to continue his further studies and went to
        England. He completed his Ph.D. degree <b>in 1927 in Economics and was awarded a Doctorate by the University of
        Columbia</b> in the same year.

    <h3>His Thoughts And Opinions -------------</h3>
    <p>B.R. Ambedkar was a leading social reformer and an activist who dedicated his entire life to the betterment of
        the Dalits and other socially backward classes of India. Ambedkar continuously fought for the eradication of
        caste discrimination that had spread like a disease in Indian society. As he was born in a socially backward
        family, Ambedkar was a Dalit who was a victim of caste discrimination and inequality. However, against all odds,
        Ambedkar became the first Dalit to complete higher education. He then went on and completed college and got a
        doctorate in economics from London University. He entered politics entirely, aiming to fight for the rights of
        the backward classes and against the inequality practiced in society. After India became independent, he went on
        to become the first law minister of free India and the chief architect of the 'Constitution of India.'Later in
        1956, he converted to Buddhism, as he considered it to be 'the most scientific religion.'
    </p>
    <p> Within 2 months of the conversion anniversary, Ambedkar died of diabetes in 1956.ConclusionBhimrao Ramji
        Ambedkar, popularly known as Baba Saheb, was a jurist, politician, economist, writer, editor. He was a Dalit who
        was a usual subject to caste discrimination. He was not allowed to eat with other caste children or even drink
        water at school. His story is the best example of determination and showcases how education can change the
        fortune of anyone. A child who was subject to caste discrimination went on to become a man who was the architect
        of Independent India's constitution. A story is written in heaven's which is the best example of not giving up
        on yourself even if the odds are against you.</p>
